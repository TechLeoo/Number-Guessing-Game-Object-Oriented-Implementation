# Number Guessing Game: Object-Oriented Implementation

## Overview

"Number Guessing Game: Object-Oriented Implementation" is a console-based application developed in Java that challenges players to guess a randomly generated 4-digit number. Utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the game offers an engaging experience where players receive feedback on their guesses, aiding them in deducing the secret number within a limited number of attempts.

## Objectives

- **Game Development:** Create an interactive console game that prompts users to guess a 4-digit number.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Implement the game using OOP principles such as classes, objects, and methods to structure the code efficiently.
- **User Interaction:** Provide clear prompts and feedback to enhance user experience.
- **Input Validation:** Ensure that user inputs are valid 4-digit numbers without repeating digits.

## Game Rules

- **Secret Number:** A 4-digit number is randomly generated, ensuring all digits are unique.
- **Player's Guess:** The player inputs a 4-digit number, also with unique digits.
- **Feedback:**
  - **Bulls:** Number of digits that are correct and in the correct position.
  - **Cows:** Number of digits that are correct but in the wrong position.
- **Objective:** Guess the secret number within a set number of attempts, using the feedback provided after each guess.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation:** Generates a secret 4-digit number with unique digits at the start of each game.
- **User Input Handling:** Accepts user guesses, ensuring they are valid 4-digit numbers with unique digits.
- **Feedback System:** After each guess, informs the player of the number of bulls and cows, guiding them toward the correct number.
- **Object-Oriented Structure:** Utilizes classes and methods to organize the game's functionality, promoting code reusability and clarity.
- **Multi-Player:** Allows for an unlimited number of players.
